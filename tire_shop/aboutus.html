                <p>This one simple, yet incredibly ambitious man (Johnny) decided to innovate on this new world of technology and challenges in the year 2024 and set out to create something timeless, not just for what would meet modern traveler requirements but future-ready. Johnny coined the brand name idea Johnny’s Tires, a dream to mend the gap of getting travelers on and off awn the road with Quality tires alongside Quality Assurance.</p>
                <p>Located in a small town along the well-worn path of travelers from throughout the realm, Johnny's Tires quickly became known for more than just their long-lasting products. Legend has it, Johnny only worked on cars newer than two years old and in return, you would receive tires that never failed upon any road no matter how treacherous as well as service so quick and effective that even the staunchest caravan driver would turn to Johnny in his time of need. The news of the tire shop spread similarly fast throughout the neighboring kingdoms, and presently nobles and merchants-together with plain folks-all began to journey here to Johnny's Tires.</p>

                <p>Johnny's Tires: When I pulled into Johnny's Tires, my geriatric wheels were on their last legs. I geared up for a trip to the Stormy Plains, where only the most heroic had ever ventured. The roads are infamous for their sharp curves and loose rocks that have taken the lives of more than one motorists. Somewhere in my mind sprouted the part where I screamed over ice when Johnny had promised me that rolling on his tires would be like standing up, not touching the earth he described as cursed lands.</p>
